### This fork is to fix the package to be installable on Laravel v7 and Laravel v8

### Installation

For Laravel 7 run:
`composer require "codebot/entrust": "^7.0"`

For Laravel 8 run:
`composer require "codebot/entrust": "^8.0"`

**I've updated dependencies only, because I had to upgrade existing Laravel project. Do not use this package for new projects, it's abandoned at this moment. [spatie/laravel-permission](https://github.com/spatie/laravel-permission) should be a good choice.**
