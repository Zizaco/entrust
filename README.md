# ENTRUST (Laravel 5 Package)
## Disclaimer
#### This is a temporary workaround for https://github.com/Zizaco/entrust/pull/459 which I would **not recommend** using (actually I did remove entrust and using Laravel's *native* Authorization) because of some misunderstandings.  
See:

I'm waiting for the author's response so please be careful, use it at your own risk :(
